**Title:** The Death Stalker Grimoires: Keter-Class Hardware Documentation

**Description:**
Welcome to the archives of the **Brotherhood of the Discord**. This repository contains *The Iron Scripture of the Oberon*, a "quick start" guide for the BC-250 (PS5 Oberon/Cyan Skillfish) mining board, written not for the sane consumer, but for the desperate acolyte.

Forget dry technical manuals. We acknowledge the truth: repurposing e-waste is an act of necromancy.

**What is this?**
This is a fully functional technical guide disguised as a piece of grimdark/Lovecraftian horror fiction. It covers the complete setup of the BC-250, including:
*   **The Blood Tax:** Physical modification of the razor-sharp heatsink (and how to survive it).
*   **The Rite of Severance:** Thermal paste replacement (PTM 7950) and VRAM padding.
*   **The Transmutation of Mind:** Flashing the unlocked BIOS/Firmware.
*   **The Infusion of Soul:** Installing Bazzite or Fedora Linux.
*   **The Governor:** Taming the voltage curves of the feral mining GPU.

**Warning:** The instructions are real, but so is the danger. The prose is satire; the serrated aluminum fins are not.
